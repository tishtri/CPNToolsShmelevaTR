Generator of hypertorus Petri net models


Description:
------------

A hypertorus is obtained from a hypercube via closing (connecting) opposite facets in each dimension. 
A cell of hypertorus grid represents a packet switching device with ports situated on facets of the unit-sized hypercube.
 A device works in full-duplex mode using store-and-forward principle with limited capacity of buffer.
 Neighboring cells are connected via merging contact places situated on common facets. 


Command line format:
--------------------

>htgen d k p b > ht_model.net


Parameters:
-----------

d   the number of dimensions;

k   the hypertorus size, actually k x k x k x ... x k - d times;

p   the number of packets in each section of the internal buffer;

b   the internal buffer available size.


Output (file) format:
---------------------

.net  “Time Petri nets textual format” according to http://www.laas.fr/tina


Tools to display, edit, visualize, and analyze generated models:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Tina Toolbox for analysis of Petri nets and Time Petri nets http://www.laas.fr/tina

Exported from Tina models are opened with other tools for Petri nets http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/TGI/PetriNets/tools/quick.html


An example:
-----------

>htgen 3 2 2 3 > ht3d2k2p3b.net

- Generate a model of a hypertorus with 3 dimensions of size 2 with 2 packets in each buffer section and 
available size of buffer 3.

>nd ht3d2k2p3b.net

- Load the model into graphical environment of Tina. 

Menue: "Edit - draw - nearto"

- Visualize the model. 

Menue: "Tools - stepper simulator - Rand"

- Watch the token game.
